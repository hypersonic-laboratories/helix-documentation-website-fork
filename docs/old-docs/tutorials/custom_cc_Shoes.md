# Custom Shoes

This guide walks you through the process of creating and packaging Custom Shoes using the [Creator Kit](https://github.com/Hyper-Ross/helix-documentation/blob/Ross_CC_Tattoos/docs/tutorials/creatorkit.md).

Before you start, have your shoe model created and ready. It’ll be easier to start with one shoe and mirror it after placement. If you have shoes for both feet I’d suggest deleting one and keeping the other or you’ll likely need to do your mesh placement in a 3d modelling package. Follow Shoe Mesh prepeartion to make sure your can follow the tutorial closer.

If you're creating open foot shoes, e.g. sandals and flip flops, step "**3. Shoe Setup**" will look different for you. You'll need to export the body template mesh, import it into you modelling package and adjust the mesh to fit exactly. You may need to be more methodical with your custom weight painting too.

## **1. Shoe Mesh Preparation**

For the purpose of this tutorial I’ll be using one shoe and mirroring it in unreal. If you’d like to follow along with me exactly and you have both shoes and it’s already bound to a skeleton, follow these steps.

1. Launch your modelling package **e.g. Blender**.
2. Import/ create your shoes.

### If you’re importing shoes that are already bound to a skeleton follow these steps:

1. In the object outliner, Open up the skeleton root until you get to your mesh.
2. Select your mesh
3. Right click the object in the viewport OR press Alt+P
4. Select Parent > Clear and Keep Transformation

1. Then delete all objects and bones other than your one shoe mesh

### If your shoe mesh is combined and contains both feet:

1. Enter edit mode by pressing TAB 
2. Enter wireframe mode 

    ![IMG_Shoes_Wireframe.png](Images_Wearables/Shoes/IMG_Shoes_Wireframe.png)

1. Drag select one of the shoes so it’s highlighted orange
2. Press the Delete key
3. Then select Faces
4. Press TAB again to exit edit mode
5. Now using the move gizmo align you remaining shoe so the heel area is aligned with the world origin
6. Also rotate your shoe on the z axis if it’s not straight

After making the required adjustments, export your shoe model out as a `.fbx`.

3. Set the skeletal mesh’s Location, Scale and rotation back to default by pressing the back arrow or set Location: 0,0,0 Rotation; 0,0,0 Scale: 1,1,1
4. Then add your shoe mesh into the scene.
5. Now align your shoe mesh to the correct foot. 
6. Then enter modelling mode by using the drop down or press Shift+6
7. With you shoe selected, press the Model tab and select Mirror.
8. Set the Preset Mirror direction to Forward and set the transform location to 0,0,0
9. If your shoe has mirrored correctly to the other foot, press Accept

1. Set **Sort Category** to the type of shoes you’re adding (e.g. Sneakers).
2. Under the Preset Skeletal Mesh by Physique array, add a new element by pressing (+).
3. Under the new **Metahuman** physique type, press (+) twice on the **Physique Body Part Skeletal Meshes** array.
4. Assign your shoe’s skeletal mesh to both the **Slim** and **Average** input.

## **8. Packing**

1. Return to the HELIX Packaging Tool window.
2. With your package selected, click the **Package** button. This process will cook your assets into the final `.pak` file format required by the HELIX Creator Hub. This may take some time.
    
    ![image.png](WearableTutImages/11.png)
    
3. Once cooking is complete, a file explorer window will automatically open, displaying your final `.pak` files. Your wearable is now ready to be uploaded to the **Creator Hub**!

## **9. Testing your Wearable**

### **1. In Creator Kit**

1. This method doesn't require you to cook the package on the previous steps. As long as you placed all the required assets in your package folder in Creator Kit, and created the data asset as explained, it automatically becomes available for editor playthroughs.
2. Press play in the **Creator Kit** editor, and press the **P** key to show the **Character Customization UI** for your character.
3. In the shown UI, you should be able to navigate to your new wearable and click on it to test it on the character. (e.g. Outfits > Shoes)

### **2. In HELIX**

1. Create a draft world and import the `.pak` file you've cooked in **Creator Kit**.
    
    ![image.png](WearableTutImages/14.png)
    
    ![image.png](WearableTutImages/15.png)
    
2. If import was successful, you should see your assets in the left panel.
3. Importing also makes your wearables automatically available in **Character Customization UI**. Go back to the game from build mode, and the press **P** key.
